*	By: Guillaume
*	 Weight: 1

###	Resources
*	7.2. Reading and Writing Files
*	8.7. Predefined Clean-up Actions
*	Dive Into Python 3: Chapter 11. Files (until “11.4 Binary Files” (included))
*	JSON encoder and decoder
*	Learn to Program 8 : Reading / Writing Files
*	Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (ch. 8 p 180-183 and ch. 14 p 326-333)
+	All about py-file I/O

###	Requirements
#####	Python Scripts
*	Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
*	 interpreter/compiler on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
*	All your files should end with a new line
*	A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

#####	Python Test Cases
*	All your test files should be inside a folder tests
*	All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
*	All your tests should be executed by using this command: 
```
	python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
```
*	All your modules should have a documentation
```
(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
```
*	All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation
```
(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
```
*	A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
